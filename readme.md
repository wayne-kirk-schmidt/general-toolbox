Installing the Project
======================

The steps are as follows: 

    1. Download and install git for your platform if you don't already have it installed.
       It can be downloaded from https://git-scm.com/downloads
    
    2. Open a new shell/command prompt. It must be new since only a new shell will include the new python 
       path that was created in step 1. Cd to the folder where you want to install the scripts.
    
    3. Clone this repo using the following command. This would create a new drectory
    
    4. Change into the folder. Type the following to install all the package dependencies 
       (this may take a while as this will download all of the libraries that it uses):

        pipenv install
        
Dependencies
============

This should be minimal, if there are requirements outside of the scripts, 
they will be listed as a file to include and drive installs from.
